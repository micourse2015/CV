# About permission

The project is open-sourced under MIT license. You can use it without an explicit statement or link to this project. 
But I'll be happy if you can do so.

### Manual Setup

To manually set up the CV, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lancebiu/CV.git
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd CV
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.
